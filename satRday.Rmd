## Why do we love R so much for data-analysis?

## Why do we love R so much for data-analysis?

We don't have to use R when using R!

## Why do we love R so much for data-analysis?

We don't have to use R when using R!

We can do

```{r}
library(dplyr)
mtcars <- mtcars %>% mutate(cyl_drat = cyl + drat)
```

or

```{r}
mtcars_dt <- data.table::as.data.table(mtcars)
mtcars_dt[, cyl_drat := cyl + drat]
```

Instead of 

```{r}
mtcars$cyl_drat <- mtcars$cyl + mtcars$drat
```

## We all use NSE!

When you started using R, did you mix up?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("padr")
```

and

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(padr)
```

## We all use NSE!

When you started using R, did you mix up?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("padr")
```

and

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(padr)
```

Or wondered why the `library(padr)` worked. Even when there is no variable callend `padr`?

## We all use NSE!

Apparantly, things that ought not to work, are working.

This results in a language full of magic:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
subset(mtcars, cyl == 6)

ggplot2::ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, drat)) +
  geom_point()

data.table::as.data.table(mtcars)[ ,mean(mpg), by = cyl]
```

## Why data analysts love it (and cs people don't)

R is designed to do data science. (Well, then it was still called statistics).

Flexibility to maiximize insight.

Enable DSL creation to tailor make tools to solve a specific problem without overhead.

With flexibility comes ambiguity and responsibility.

## Why should you care about how NSE works?

## Why should you care about how NSE works?

* Because you are a geek who can't stand not knowing.

## Why should you care about how NSE works?

* Because you are a geek who can't stand not knowing.
* Because most R users slip into tool design sooner or later.

## What is standard in the first place?

```{r, error=TRUE}
my_val <- 123

my_func <- function(x) {
  x / 42 * 121
}

my_func(71)

my_func(my_val)

my_func(your_val)
```

##

## What's in a NAME

By creating a variable we bind a **value** to a **name**.

```{r}
my_val <- 123
```

123 is the **value** that is bound to the **name** `my_val`.

Binding happens in an environment, in this case the global.

## What's in a NAME

```{r}
my_val <- 123
```

123 is the **value** that is bound to the **name** `my_val`.

Binding happens in an environment, in this case the global.

Just call my name, I'll give you the value:

```{r}
my_val
```

This is *evaluating* the name.

## Lexical scoping

R starts looking for the value of name in the environment the name is called in.

```{r}
x <- "a variable in the global"
a_func <- function() {
  x <- "a variable in the local"
  x
}
a_func()
```

## Lexical scoping

When it can't find it locally, move up to the parent environment (where the current env was created).

```{r}
z <- "a variable in the global"
another_func <- function() {
  z
}
another_func()
```

## Lexical scoping

Finally, an error is thrown when the variable can't be found.

```{r, error=TRUE}
nobody_loves_me <- function() {
  y
}
nobody_loves_me()
```

So this is standard evaluation in R. 

## Wait for it

We can also ask R to postpone judgement, by storing the variable name in a **name object**.

```{r}
quote(my_unknown_var) %>% class()
```

## Wait for it

We can also ask R to postpone judgement, by storing the variable name in a **name object**.

```{r}
quote(my_unknown_var) %>% class()
```

This is the act of **quoting**, saving a variable name to be evaluated later.

(**name** is also called **symbol**)

## Wait for it

Quoted variable names are not evaluated. It doesn't matter if they don't exist.

```{r}
quoted_var <- quote(wait_for_it)
quoted_var
quoted_var %>% class()
```

## Wait for it

Quoted variable names are not evaluated. It doesn't matter if they don't exist.

```{r}
quoted_var <- quote(wait_for_it)
quoted_var
quoted_var %>% class()
```

We have two variables here:

The regular variable `quoted_var` contains the quoted variable `wait_for_it`.

## Wait for it

It will start looking for the value only when we ask to evaluate it.

```{r, error=TRUE}
eval(quoted_var)
```

## Wait for it

```{r}
wait_for_it <- "I finally have a value"
eval(quoted_var)
```

## What is the use?

## What is the use?

We can evaluate the `name` in a different environment.

## Building our own `pull`

```{r}
diy_pull <- function(x, name) {
  eval(name, envir = x)
}

diy_pull(mtcars, quote(cyl)) %>% head(5)
```

## Building our own `pull`

```{r}
diy_pull <- function(x, name) {
  eval(name, envir = x)
}

diy_pull(mtcars, quote(cyl)) %>% head(5)
```

Note that we can specify a data frame as environment. The column names can be called as variables within it.

## Quoting inside the function

You'll never have to quote your function arguments when using a DSL.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% select(cyl)
as.data.table(mtcars)[, cyl]
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl)) + geom_bar()
```

Why does R not throw an error? There is no `cyl` in the global...

## Lazy, lazy R

<center><img src="koala.jpeg" height="525px" width="600" /></center>

## Lazy, lazy R

```{r}
koala <- function(x, y) {
  x + 42
}

koala(3)
```

## Industrious Python

```{python, error=TRUE}
def koala(x, y):
  return(x + 42)

koala(3)
```

## Quoting inside a function

So, R doesn't make a fuss until it really has to.

This allows quoting inside functions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
diy_pull_2 <- function(x, bare_name) {
  name <- quote(bare_name)
  eval(name, env = x)
}
```

## Quoting inside a function

This allows quoting inside functions.

```{r, error=TRUE}
diy_pull_2 <- function(x, bare_name) {
  name <- quote(bare_name)
  eval(name, env = x)
}

diy_pull_2(mtcars, cyl)
```

## Quoting inside a function

`quote` does literally quote the input, but we want to quote the value at the argument, not the arg's name.

Here we need `substitute`:

```{r}
substitute_example <- function(x) {
  substitute(x)
}
substitute_example(cyl)
substitute_example(cyl) %>% class()
```

## Quoting inside a function

```{r, error=TRUE}
diy_pull_2 <- function(x, bare_name) {
  name <- substitute(bare_name)
  eval(name, env = x)
}

diy_pull_2(mtcars, cyl)
```

## Not just names

We can quote the following things:

* *name*: the name of an R object

* *call*: calling of a function

* *pairlist*: something from the past you shouldn't bother about

* *literal*: evaluates to the value itself

## Expressions: "don't be another SQL"

<center><img src="express.gif" height="525px" width="800" /></center>

## Call

Just like a **name**, a function **call** can be delayed by quoting.

```{r}
my_little_filter <- function(x, 
                             call) {
  call_quoted <- substitute(call)
  retain_row  <- eval(call_quoted, envir = x)
  x[retain_row, ]
}

my_little_filter(mtcars, cyl == 4 & gear == 4) %>% head(2)
```

## The **promise** you make

<img src="cock-robin.png" height="525px" width="700" />

## That's a *promise*

<img src="promise.png" height="525px" width="800" />

## That's a *promise*

The value slot is empty at promise creation.

Only when the argument's expression is evaluated in the function, we start looking for it. 

## That's a *promise*

The value slot is empty at promise creation.

Only when the argument's expression is evaluated in the function, we start looking for it. 

Remember `koala`?

```{r}
koala <- function(x, y) {
  x + 42
}
```

## Promising koala

When we call `koala` we create the following promise

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x_value <- 42
koala(x = x_value)
```

<center><img src="koala-promise.png" height="262.5" width="400" /></center>

## Accessing the expression slot!

Now, that's why `subsitute` works!

Accesses the expression in the promise without evaluating it.

```{r}
subs_func <- function(val) {
  vals_expr <- substitute(val)
  deparse(vals_expr)
}
subs_func(anything_goes)
```

Note that `deparse` coerces the expression to a character. Its inverse is `parse`.

## Tidyeval

The `tidyverse` NSE dialect.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% select(cyl)
```

We now know that `cyl` gets somehow quoted by `select` and evaluated within the data frame.

But what if we want to wrap tidyverse code in a custom function?

## Tidyeval - custom function

This won't work

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_tv_func <- function(x, grouping_var) {
  x %>% 
    group_by(grouping_var) %>% 
    summarise(max_drat = max(drat))
}
my_tv_func(mtcars, cyl)
```

Why?

## Tidyeval - custom function

In order to get it to work:

* quote the variable, like in regular R
* unquote again before the argument is swallowed by the tidyverse function
* then tidyverse function can go back and quote it again

## Tidyeval - custom function

In order to get it to work:

* quote the variable upfront
* unquote again before the argument is swallowed by the tidyverse function
* then tidyverse function can go back and quote it again

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_tv_func <- function(x, grouping_var) {
  x %>% 
    group_by(!!grouping_var) %>% 
    summarise(max_drat = max(drat))
}
my_tv_func(mtcars, quo(cyl))
```

## Tidyeval - custom function

Just like using `substitute` you can quote the arguments value with `enquo`.

```{r}
my_grouping_func <- function(x, grouping_var) {
  grouping_var_q <- enquo(grouping_var)
  x %>% 
    group_by(!!grouping_var_q) %>% 
    summarise(max_drat = max(drat))
}
my_grouping_func(mtcars, cyl)
```

## Summary

<center><img src="homer.png" height="500px" width="500" /></center>

## Summary

```{r}
my_correct_second_little_filter <- function(x, bare_call) {
  call <- substitute(bare_call)
  x[eval(call, envir = x), ]
}

my_correct_second_little_filter(mtcars, cyl == 4) %>% head(1)
```

* `cyl == 4` on itself is invalid, there is no `cyl` in the global.
* But, R refrains from judgement, stores it in a promise.
* `substitute` gets the expression, which is the quoted call.
* This expression is evaluated within the environment of `x`.
* Here it is completely valid, because there is a `cyl` column.
